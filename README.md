# Plant-Disease-Detection

A deep learning-based image classification model to detect plant leaf diseases using transfer learning (ResNet18) on the PlantVillage dataset.

## Project Overview

Plant diseases can significantly impact crop production. This project uses a ResNet18 model (pretrained on ImageNet) fine-tuned on the **PlantVillage** dataset to identify **38 different plant diseases and healthy leaves**.

## Dataset

- ğŸ“¥ Source: [PlantVillage Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease)
- ğŸ“Š Contains over **50,000 labeled images** of plant leaves (both healthy and diseased)


## Model Architecture

- ğŸ”¸ **ResNet18** pretrained on ImageNet
- ğŸ”¸ Final layer replaced with `nn.Linear` to match 38 output classes
- ğŸ”¸ Loss Function: CrossEntropyLoss
- ğŸ”¸ Optimizer: Adam
- ğŸ”¸ Accuracy Achieved: **96% on validation set**
